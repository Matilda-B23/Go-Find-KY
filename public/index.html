        North America is home to so many unique and fascinating birds! It is easy to not notice them; they seem to be everywhere! I discovered my love for bird watching using the 'Merlin' app which is a wonderful tool to use alongside this site. You can record audio of a bird and the merlin app will tell you a guess of what bird it is!
        I also wanted to create this project with the goal of showing which birds have an endangered status, to inform and educate on the enviroment and how much impact humans have on the enviroment as a whole.

        To start logging, simply click the 'Quick Log' button, or navigate to
        the 'Log' page, where it will take you to a page to select or narrow
        down what bird you have seen, or you can simply browse available birds. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, the 'My Journal' page is where you can see what birds you have already logged, and see how many out of all bird species in Kentucky you have seen!
      </p>
      <p>See if you can log them all!</p>
