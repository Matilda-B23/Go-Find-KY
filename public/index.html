        <h2>Welcome to My Bird Journal!</h2>
        <p>
          North America is home to so many unique and fascinating birds! It is
          easy to not notice them; they seem to be everywhere!
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered my love for bird watching using the 'Merlin' app which is
          a wonderful tool, which I highly recommend to use alongside this site.
          In Merlin, you can record audio of a bird, or search by size and color
          and the merlin app will tell you a guess of what bird it is!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also wanted to create this project with the goal of showing which
          birds have an endangered status, to inform and educate on how many
          birds we see every day could possibly be endangered, or birds that
          need protection and are declining in population.

          To start logging, simply click the 'Quick Log' button to navigate to
          the 'Log' page, where it will take you to a page to select or narrow
          down what bird you have seen, or browse available birds. You can mark
          birds as seen, and also write a short comment like where or when you
          spotted the bird.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the 'My Journal' page is where you can see what birds you have
          already logged, and see how many out of all bird species in North
          America you have seen!
        </p>
        <p>See if you can log them all!</p>
