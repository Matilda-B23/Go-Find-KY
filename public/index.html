        <h2>Welcome to My Bird Journal!</h2>
        <p>
          North America is home to so many unique and fascinating birds! It is
          easy to take them for granted, since they seem to be everywhere, but
          when you stop and really pay attention, you can see just how
          biodiverse birds truly are.
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered a love for birdwatching using the Merlin app, a wonderful
          tool, which I highly recommend using alongside this site. With Merlin,
          you can record bird audio, or search by size and color to identify
          what bird you're hearing or seeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created this project to highlight birds with endangered or declining
          populations, helping educate users on how many familiar birds may need
          protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start logging, simply click the "Log a sighting" button to navigate
          to the log page. There, you can browse birds, mark them as seen, and
          add a short comment to remember your sighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'My Journal' page lets you view what birds you've already logged,
          view and edit your comments, and see how many of North America's bird
          species you've spotted.
        </p>
        <p>See if you can log them all!</p>
