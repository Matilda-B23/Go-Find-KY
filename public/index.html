        North America is home to so many unique and fascinating birds! It is easy to not notice them; they seem to be everywhere! I discovered my love for bird watching using the 'Merlin' app which is a wonderful tool, which I highly reccomend to use alongside this site. You can record audio of a bird, or search by size and color and the merlin app will tell you a guess of what bird it is!
        I also wanted to create this project with the goal of showing which birds have an endangered status, to inform and educate on how many birds we see every day could possibly be endangered, or protected.

        To start logging, simply click the 'Quick Log' button to navigate to
        the 'Log' page, where it will take you to a page to select or narrow
        down what bird you have seen, or you can simply browse available birds. 
        You can mark birds as seen, and also write a short comment such as where you were, or any way you'd like to remember the sighting!

        Lastly, the 'My Journal' page is where you can see what birds you have already logged, and see how many out of all bird species in North America you have seen!
      </p>
      <p>See if you can log them all!</p>
