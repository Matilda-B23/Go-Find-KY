    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <p>You can use the search function in the top right to search for a bird by name. If you're unsure, I recommend using the 'Merlin' app to help narrow down your search.</p>
    <p>The checkmark will count as you saying you have sighted the featured bird. The browser will save your data so you don't have to worry about losing your sightings!</p>
    <p>The comment box is for anything you wish to put there really; for instance, where the sighting took place, what time, or even what you were doing at the time! It can be fun to look back and remember that exact moment.</p>
    <p>The final element is the status area. It features the conservation status of the selected bird, be it *****PUT THE STATUSES HERE***** For reference there is a graphic in the top corner to briefly explain the different statuses.</p>    
    <div id="bird-container"></div>  <!-- HTML element where bird cards information is added -->
          <script src="/JavaScript/script.js" defer></script>
