    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <p>
      You can use the search function in the top right to search for a bird by
      name. If you're unsure, I recommend using the 'Merlin' app to help narrow
      down your search.
    </p>
    <p>
      The checkmark will count as you saying you have sighted the featured bird.
      The browser will save your data so you don't have to worry about losing
      your sightings!
    </p>
    <p>
      The comment box is for anything you wish to put there really; for
      instance, where the sighting took place, what time, or even what you were
      doing at the time! It can be fun to look back and remember that exact
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final element is the status area. It features the conservation status
      of the selected bird, from low concern so birds in good population, to
      declining population, to those species threatened with extinction.
